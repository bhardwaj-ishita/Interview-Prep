/**
 * <h1>Intersection of Two Linked Lists</h1>
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/
 * Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect.
 * If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
 *
 * Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

    1) Traverse the list 1, store the last node address
    2) Traverse the list 2, store the last node address.

     *     then during the 4th loop a != null --> a.next and b != null --> b.next
     *     hence both a and b will be at the same node a==b

     *      and b will still be traversing the list
     *      a == null --> headB && b != null --> b.next
     *      then a will start traversing listB
     *      then there will be a point when b == null --> headA && a != null --> a.next
     *      at this point a has covered x((length of listA and y-x)==length of listB) and have to cover
     *      at this point b has covered y(length of listB)
     *      and both have to travel the x(length of listA)
     *       in the second traversal, swapping a and b synchronizes a and b before the end of the second traversal.
     *       By synchronizing a and b I mean both have the same remaining steps in the second traversal so that it's
     *       guaranteed for them to reach the first intersection node, or reach null at the same time
     *       (technically speaking, in the same iteration)
     *
     * CASE3: there is no intersection
     *      if there is no intersection and length is same a and b will reach the null in the first iteration
     *      and at the same time
     *      or else if the length is not same then they'll reach null at the end of second iteration
