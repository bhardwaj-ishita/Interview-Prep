order by s.Id

/*
when we left join students to jobs we take all students irrespective of if there is an id for it in Jobs or not
so for students with no jobs job table will be null

Now out of this table we group them by students id
That is now, all the jobs will be grouped for each student 1:4 jobs relations 2:3 jobs relations

Out of this we will take the sum of all the jobs with dates in month 11: if in the date there is a month november +1 else +0
and club these sums for each student id (we grouped them for all students respectively)
In the order of their id
