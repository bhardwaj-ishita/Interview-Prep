select concat_ws('',dir.director_first_name,director_last_name) as director_name, mov.movie_title as movie_title
from movies_directors md
join directors dir on dir.director_id = md.director_id
join movies mov on mov.movie_id = md.movie_id
join movies_cast mc on mc.movie_id = mov.movie_id 
where mc.role = 'SeanMaguire'


used concat_ws here 
we needed info from other tables hence join them
we need a particular title of the column

and once variables given to tables, use the variables itself

I was using movies_cast insted of mc
