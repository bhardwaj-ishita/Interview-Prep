/*Here you gave a number of tests everyday
And the test id are random

You need to output the tests where you improved from previous test performance

So you output testID from Tests Table
and because you need to compare with your previous performances itself
you join the tabele such that the curret performance is adjacent to the previous test given

Tests.TestId   Tests.marks  t.TestID  t.marks
  50                20          -       -
  53                35          50       20
  55                21          53       20*/
  
  This will be the joined table
  This is what happens when you join the table with Tests.TestID = t.TestID - 1
  And in this table get testID for tests where marks are more than previous
  Tests.Marks > t.Marks
